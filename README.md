Hi 
I’m currently working on a school project and I’m trying to read the temperature and humidity. I have a Arduino uno with a base shield placed on top of it. I have plugged a dht11 in port D2. 
I’m new to this so I tried working out the code myself, but I keep getting stuck on a error message displaying “expected primary-expression before '.' token”. 
I hope someone can help me and explain what I’m doing wrong.
